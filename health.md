Steps to improve health:
1. Set temperature to 22°C (±2°C) - necessary to be able to check anything else
    - you can check your body temperature by putting your dry palm around your (other) dry wrist
2. Remove bits of food/beard hairs that are stuck in your mouth/nose - not doing so causes everything else to fail
3. Breathe heavily - necessary to be able to check hydration
    - air quality doesn't matter too much, you can compensate for it by breathing more
4. Drink water
5. Eat some sugar
    - tea with 1/3 tsp honey and without milk works well
    - a cola could work if you can find one with low caffeine and low but non-zero (4-8g/100ml?) sugar content
    - candy is an okay option
    - chips are an okay option if you don't eat too many
6. Take some micronutrients - helps to improve your mood

    - Na (sodium, DV=2300 mg), Cl (chloride, DV=2300 mg):
        - not all salts contain both sodium and chloride, and it's unclear which products use which salts
        - so uhh, cook your own food with table salt (sodium chloride)?

    - TODO: check for better multivitamin sources (juice?, gummies?)
    - currently the strat is a low amount of milk (10ml) per day + sunlight + a DrWitt (relax) bottle
7. If you want to lose some weight
    - you can try having some honey, instead of milk/yoghurt/chocolate/ice cream/chips
    - excercise helps, though you can do literally anything you want (cycling/walking/playing a physically intersive video game like Beat Saber or Ring Fit Adventure)

- Fruit tangent:
    - nowadays fruit has been bred to be extremely sweet, too sweet one might say
    - for example, i would treat apples the same as candy - drink tons water with it
    - however some fruits can be fine, like bananas (+ you get some micronutrients)
