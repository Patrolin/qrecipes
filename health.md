Steps to improve health:
1. Set temperature to 20-22°C (minimum is 18-24.5°C) - necessary to be able to check anything else
    - you can check your body temperature by putting your **dry** palm around your (other) **dry** wrist \
      (it shouldn't feel hot or cold)
    - TODO: figure out a way to measure air temperature vs room temperature?
2. Remove bits of food/beard hairs that are stuck in your mouth/nose - not doing so causes everything else to fail
3. Breathe heavily - necessary to be able to check hydration
    - your body only detects CO<sub>2</sub> levels, not oxygen levels..
4. Drink water
5. Eat some sugar - in order to not have a headache
    - NOTE: you must always ensure oxygen and hydration are in order first!
    - options
        - 1 tsp honey by itself (temperatures above 38°C destroy enzymes..)
        - a cola could work if you can find one with low caffeine and low but non-zero (4-8g/100ml?) sugar content
        - candy is an okay option
        - chips are an okay option if you don't eat too many
    - fruit tangent:
        - nowadays fruit has been bred to be extremely sweet, too sweet one might say
        - for example, i would treat apples the same as candy - drink tons water with it
        - however some fruits can be fine, like bananas (+ you get some micronutrients)
6. Take some micronutrients - helps to improve your mood

7. If you want to lose some weight (also helps improve your mood)
    - you can't skip breakfast, otherwise you won't have energy to do anything
    - you can skip lunch, which is an easy win
    - probably don't skip dinner?
    - excercise helps, though you can do literally anything you want (walking/cycling/playing a physically intersive video game like Beat Saber or Ring Fit Adventure)
