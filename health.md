Steps to improve health:
1. Set temperature to 22°C (±2°C) - necessary to be able to check anything else
    - you can check your body temperature by putting your palm around your wrist
2. Breathe quickly - necessary to be able to check hydration
    - air quality doesn't matter too much, you can compensate for it by breathing more
3. Drink water
4. Eat some sugar
    - tea with 1/3 tsp honey and without milk works well
    - candy or chips are okay options if you also drink water with it
    - a cola could work if you can find one with low caffeine and low but non-zero (4-8g?) sugar content
6. Take some vitamin supplements - helps to improve your mood
    - you can get some small bottled water with added vitamins, like DrWitt
    - multivitamin juice also works pretty well
7. If you want to lose some weight
    - you can try having some honey, instead of milk/yoghurt/chocolate/ice cream
    - excercise helps, though you can do literally anything you want (cycling/walking/playing a physically intersive video game like Beat Saber or Ring Fit Adventure)
