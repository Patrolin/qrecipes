## weight/volume
```
1cup ≈ 300ml
1g X ≈ 1ml X    // X = { water, milk, sugar }    // 1kg/l = 1g/ml
1 tsp ≈ 6ml
1 tbsp ≈ 15ml
```

## temperature
```
solid to liquid transition energy of water = +80°C
=> 115g -18°C ice + 300g 67°C water    // (115*(-18-80) + 300 * 67) / 400 = 22.075
   = 315g 22°C water
boiling point
  water: 100°C
